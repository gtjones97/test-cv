                <p>So what is BEAR Day? In this case, BEAR is an acronym for Breakthroughs in Engagement, the Arts, and Research. This event consists of poster sessions, musical presentations and art show exhibits. This year, the program has over 130 presentations with contributions from over 200 students. According to Dr. Glasgow, the Senior Vice Provost for Research at Mercer, "BEAR Day demonstrates and honors the achievements of students and highlights the depth and breadth of the academic experiences at Mercer".</p>

                    <h4>GENERAL POSTERS</h4>

                    <p>Yesterday, The University Center showcased students' posters of research and special projects they had been working on all year. Students from all schools, including the College of Liberal Arts, Stetson School of Business and Economics, Townsend School of Music, the School of Engineering, Tift College of Education, and the College of Health Professions came to share their findings and achievements. </p>
                    <p>One student, Bharani Gudla, gave a presentation on the development of a method to find lncRNAs in muscles. LncRNAs (or long non-coding RNAs) are defined as transcripts longer than 200 nucleotides that are not translated into protein. Here is a picture of his poster.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>This project sought to make the visualization of lncRNAs in muscle cells easily attainable. According to Gudla, "Bear Day gave me the opprtunity to present my team's work that I have been working a very long time on, almost one year. To have that opportunity was very gratifying and made me very proud."</p>

                    <h4>ART EXHIBITION</h4>
                    <ul class="article">
                        <li><span><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-time"> </i>April 7, 2018</span></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>This past Friday, the Plunkett Art Gallery, located in the Hardeman Fine Arts Building, published works of art created by Mercer University's very own student body. Many of these pieces can be seen on the gallery page, following the link in the header or by clicking here. The Tubman Museum in Macon hosted a reception on Friday evening for the senior exhibition as well.</p>
                    <p>Below is my favorite piece of photography from the exhibit, created by Madison Allen.</p>
                    <br>
                    <div class="text-center">
                        <img src="images/photography.jpg" alt="gudla_poster" width="600px" height="400px">
                    </div>
                    <p>One would be surprised at the very creative pieces that students were able to come up with. Along with paintings and photography, there were also 3D creations and sculptures. BEAR Day is not just about research and engineering, but to study the nature of art and support the students that create it. Art makes us think more deeply, strive more intently, and feel joy more profoundly.</p>
