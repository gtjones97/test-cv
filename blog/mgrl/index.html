It has proven to be a rewarding career-starter that constantly challenges me to think creatively and critically, maximize my productivity, teach myself new technologies, communicate effectively with vendors &#43; library staff &#43; patrons, and research solutions to the complex problems that face me. There are fourteen branches in the system, each having their own network and needs, and except for the I.T. director, <b>I am currently the only technician supporting these fourteen branches.</b><br><br>Needless to say, every day is an adventure that forces me outside the comfort zone, where true growth occurs. Below, you can read about my endeavors at MGRL and why they are important for my professional growth.</h4>

                                        <div class="accordion-inner">
                                            <p>During the spring of 2020, the library system received a grant that provided the main library &#40;Washington Memorial Library in Macon, GA&#41; with funds on the condition that the funds be used for RFID and self-check machines. I, along with my team, quickly got to work weighing our options and eventually landed on <a href="https://www.bibliotheca.com/" target="_blank" style="color: #cf1e01;">Bibliotecha</a> to provide these services. <br><br>Over the next few weeks, we met with representatives several times to go over their solutions, pricing options, what needed to be done before the project could start, and what the execution would look like. Before the project could even begin, the library needed to have new doors put on. Once that was dealt with, I.T. staff was able to guide the library through the rest of the process. All of the books &#40;yes, every single book that goes through the library&#41; had to be tagged with an RFID sticker. I.T. staff set up the tagging machines with software provided by Bibliotecha and then trained circulation staff on how to use them. <br><br>In a matter of weeks, all of the books had been tagged. After making sure there were data access points available and collecting all the necessary server &amp; network information, we were ready to install the RFID security gates and subsequently install the self-checkout kiosks. This phase only took a few days, although those days were packed. During that time, we met with a Bibliotecha technician and helped him install the RFID-reading gates as well as set up the self check kiosks. After configuring each of the kiosks and loading up the management software, we were able to train staff on how to use and control the machines so that they may relay that information to patrons.<br><br>At this point in time, it has been a few weeks since the installation finished. Patrons love the ease of use of the new machines, and I'm sure they are decreasing the load on circulation staff during busy hours. Hopefully, this project will allow us to pursue other avenues in the future that were not available before, such as unattended patron access after regular library hours.</p>

                                            <p>During the summer of 2020, my team regularly met with ISP technicians to assist them with bandwidth upgrades. Our work included configuring firewalls, replacing circuits, setting up Meraki access points, and running tests on the network for all of the 13 branches across middle Georgia. The project as a whole took several weeks time and hundreds of miles on the road to complete, but fulfilled the main prerequisite for one of our future projects' which would be setting up a VoIP telephone system. Also, the libraries now boast stronger networks that allow more patrons to get the information they need with ease.</p>

                                            <p>The last head of I.T. was afraid to throw things away, which is understandable. You don't want to lose anything and then regret it. However, when I arrived at MGRL there was an attic <b>full</b> of old/obsolete equipment, cords, empty boxes, you name it. Something had to be done. So together, my supervisor and I spent a week taking inventory of everything that was staying and everything that needed to be recycled. We contacted an electronics recycling company and then met with them so that they could take it all away to be repurposed/recycled. I loved the idea that our old equipment would have new life in the hands of less fortunate communities.<br><br>After recycling, we organized the server room from scratch so now everything has a home and it makes our lives easier every day. As time permits, we will coordinate with the recycling company to clear the clutter at other branches, which thankfully will not be as time-consuming.</p>

                                            <p>Through the myriad of grants and upgrades, I have learned how to prepare contracts &amp; proposals for vendors, test the feasibility of solutions, and budget for large projects while communicating effeciently and respectfully with vendors over the phone, over email, and in person. The equipment and services that we offer to the public require constant upgrades, replacements, and troubleshooting, so keeping a good relationship with vendors is important.</p>

In order to make the maintenance more accessible and streamlined, as well as make searching for resources simpler for patrons, the library system has decided to adopt <a style="color: #cf1e01;" href="https://www.asus.com/us/Chrome-Devices/Chromebox/" target="_blank">Chromebox</a> computers for the patrons to use.</p>
                                            <p>A nifty thing about these devices is that they can be managed from any device/location using Google's Admin Dashboard. Also, they have managed guest session capabilities, which is perfect for the kiosk-oriented system that these OPACs are used in.</p>
                                            <p>My job was to enroll the devices in my Google Admin account, and subsequently design and implement the rules for the devices for the follow that ensure a fresh session on every boot, and pretty much lockdown every feature on the device that did not include Internet access to a few specific webpages.</p>
                                            <p>Now, all of the OPAC computers can be managed from my console no matter where I am, and the library staff have nothing to worry about aside from turning the machine on. Now, it is more simpler than ever for a patron to instantly find the resources they were searching for.</p>

                                            <p>When I joined the library, the IT department had been using Google Forms for their ticketing system. For a small operation, this would not have been such an issue. However, with many different issues coming in from different branches and with Google Forms lacking some capabilities like messaging and decent record-keeping, I quickly realized that a new ticketing system was needed for the whole system.</p>
                                            <p>After researching different options, I led the implementation of a robust, open-source ticketing system called osTicket. This allowed issues to be resolved in a more organized fashion, allowed for email integration, and an account system that promoted consistency throughout the whole platform. I installed the software on a web server in our office and configured the environment over the course of a week or two. I recieved many praises from my supervisor for taking the initiative to find a better solution for our ticketing system. After all, it is the primary interface we have between ourselves and our clients.</p>

                                            <p>In order to receive important chunks of funding (i.e., <a href="https://galibtech.georgialibraries.org/home" style="color: #cf1e01" target="_blank">libtech</a> and <a href="https://georgialibraries.org/census-toolkit/" style="color: #cf1e01" target="_blank">census</a>), the IT department at MGRL was tasked with creating a viable purchasing plan for patron-focused items so that we may later be reimbursed. <br><br>There were several stipulations encompassing vendor &amp; item limitations. It was the current department head's first time completing this project, which gave us both many opportunities to learn the ropes of funding acquisition. </p>
                                            <p>
                                                I am very proud of the work I did regarding this project. I put in a lot of time communicating with vendors, requesting and juggling quotes, thoroughly documenting every transaction, and concurrently trying to use the money effeciently so that every item bought has a distinct purpose in the system.</p>
                                            <p>This project strengthened my abilities in professionally communicating with vendors and department heads, working with a budget under strict circumstances, and managing enormous spreadsheets.
