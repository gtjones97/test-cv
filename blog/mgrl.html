It has proven to be a rewarding career-starter, constantly challenging me to solve problems for people that rely on the library for their tech needs. There are thirteen branches in the system, each having their own network and needs. Below, you will find some of the projects I have been working on and why they are important for my professional growth.</h4>

                                        <div class="accordion-inner visible">
                                            <p>When I joined the library, the IT department had been using Google Forms for their ticketing system. For a small operation, this would not have been such an issue. However, with many different issues coming in from different branches and with Google Forms lacking some capabilities like messaging and decent record-keeping, I quickly realized that a new ticketing system was needed for the whole system.</p>
                                            <p>After researching different options, I led the implementation of an open source, robust ticketing system called osTicket. This allowed issues to be resolved in a more organized fashion, allowed for email integration, and an account system that promoted consistency throughout the whole platform. I installed the software on a web server in our office and configured the environment over the course of a week or two. I recieved many praises from my supervisor for taking the initiative to find a better solution for our ticketing system. After all, it is the primary interface we have between ourselves and our clients.</p>

                                            <p>To put it softly, the last head of I.T. had a fear of throwing things away. When I arrived at MGRL, there was an attic full of old, obsolete equipment, cords, empty boxes, you name it. Together, my supervisor and I spent a week taking inventory of the systems that could be recycled, organizing the server room, and basically finding a new home for everything.</p>

                                            <p>Cost-cutting is a learned skill that is crucial to have in any business, but I think it is vital for a government entity such as a library. Saving money while providing high quality services is our main goal. I have learned how to talk to vendors, how to compare prices, and how to test the feasibility of certain projects, among other things. In the world of information technology, products require constant upgrades, replacements, and troubleshooting. This has taught me to communicate with vendors and select products that we need with cost in mind.</p>

                                            <p><b>O</b>nline <b>P</b>ublic <b>A</b>ccess <b>C</b>atalog computers enable patrons to view the current resource collection at the library. In order to make the maitenance more accessible and streamlined, as well as make searching for resources simpler for patrons, the library system has decided to adopt <a href="https://www.asus.com/us/Chrome-Devices/Chromebox/" target="_blank">Chromebox</a> computers for the patrons to use.</p>
                                            <p>A nifty thing about these devices is that they can be managed from any device/location using Google's Admin Dashboard. Also, they have managed guest session capabilities, which is perfect for the kiosk-oriented system that these OPACs are used in.</p>
                                            <p>My job was to enroll the devices in my Google Admin account, and subsequently design and implement the rules for the devices for the follow that ensure a fresh session on every boot, and pretty much lockdown every feature on the device that did not include Internet access to a few specific webpages.</p>
                                            <p>Now, all of the OPAC computers can be managed from my console no matter where I am, and the library staff have nothing to worry about aside from turning the machine on. Now, it is more simpler than ever for a patron to instantly find the resources they were searching for.</p>

                                        <div class="accordion-inner">
                                            <p>In order to receive important chunks of funding (i.e., <a href="https://galibtech.georgialibraries.org/home" style="color: #cf1e01" target="_blank">libtech</a> and <a href="https://georgialibraries.org/census-toolkit/" style="color: #cf1e01" target="_blank">census</a>), the IT department at MGRL was tasked with creating a viable purchasing plan for patron-focused items so that we may later be reimbursed. <br><br>There were several stipulations encompassing vendor & item limitations. It was the current department head's first time completing this project, which gave us both many opportunities to learn the ropes of funding acquisition. </p>
                                            <p>
                                                I am very proud of the work I did regarding this project. I put in a lot of time communicating with vendors, requesting and juggling quotes, thoroughly documenting every transaction, and concurrently trying to use the money effeciently so that every item bought has a distinct purpose in the system.</p>
                                            <p>This project strengthened my abilities in professionally communicating with vendors and department heads, working with a budget under strict circumstances, and managing enormous spreadsheets.
