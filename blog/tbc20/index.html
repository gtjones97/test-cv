                                                    <p> is an initiative of the Georgia Public Library Service to bring together IT professionals from library systems across the state to share experiences and ideas, allowing participants to explore opportunities made possible by emerging technologies.</p>

                                            <h4>Occurring every year, <a href="https://galibtech.georgialibraries.org/emerging/tech-boot-camp" target="_blank">Tech Boot Camp &#40;TBC&#41;</a> is regarded as a treasured experience by Georgia library professionals in the I.T. field because of the many benefits that come from networking with colleagues from all over the state and learning about the latest innovations in library technology directly from the experts. Usually it is held in person at Unicoi State Park in North Georgia, where attendees spend several days essentially living with their colleagues while connecting over meals, sitting in on presentations, playing with the newest tech gadgets, and learning how they can use this information to benefit their patrons back home.
                                                <br>
                                                <br>
                                                This year, however, TBC was held virtually, which may seem like a limited experience, but the significance still rang true. On the contrary, I believe that the virtual platform allowed for more training segments to be included and less barriers for communication, so I would not say that my experience was limited. Over four days, we covered five important tracks: <span style="color: #1a8fc6">access</span>, <span style="color: #1a8fc6">cybersecurity</span>, <span style="color: #1a8fc6">grants</span>, <span style="color: #1a8fc6">tech</span>, and <span style="color: #1a8fc6">statistics</span>. Understanding these topics is necessary to succeed as a library, so I was glad to see that each was explored in-depth through a variety of panels and training workshops while leaving lots of room for discussion amongst the community. Keep reading to see how these trainings will be applied.
                                                <br>
                                                <br>
                                                TBC is first and foremost an opportunity for library IT professionals to learn about the most recent developments in their field, which is wonderful in itself. But even so, I quickly learned that the time I spent <i>outside</i> the live stream was of equal or greater importance. Meeting the people that I am usually only CC’d alongside, being able to put faces and voices to their names immediately let me relate more to them and allowed me to be more comfortable sharing my problems with them. Talking with them reinforced the notion that we are indeed one large community, even though we are all spread across the state. <b>We may be invested in different libraries, but the obstacles we face are very much alike, so the relationships that one builds at TBC become priceless.</b>
                                                <br>
                                                <br>
                                                Some of the attendees lamented over the fact that we were unable to meet in person this year, which I understand. It's harder to build meaningful relationships online, especially when you've got last year's French toast breakfast on the mind. But at the same time, I noticed some advantages to going virtual. First of all, attendance was higher this year than any year before, likely because it is much much easier for one to attend from their very own office. Secondly, I enjoyed the livestream format because it allowed attendees to converse without interrupting the presenter; asking questions that might not have been asked otherwise. This is not to say that I don't see the merits to hosting the event in person, but there are advantages to both options. Lastly, because we were posting on the online message board, I felt that everyone had an equal voice and the discussion was able to flow more freely, and in this way I felt that communication was more efficient. So although I wasn't able to get the full physical experience of TBC, the payoff is still clear. I feel that I not only learned a great deal of important knowledge, but also gained more confidence to tackle large problems knowing that I have colleagues there to help me along the way, if and when I need it. I hope I get another opportunity next year to do it "right".

                                            <p>Cybersecurity occupied most of the training slots, and for good reason. It's vital that every library knows how to protect their networks &#40;hence, their information&#41; against intrusions, especially in 2020. With cybercrime on the rise in every sector, it would be foolish to assume that libraries get a free pass. And while I was already familiar with most of the information because of my past studies, it's never a bad idea to brush up on cyberdefense.<br><br>I attended several presentations hosted by professionals from <a href="https://georgialibraries.org/" target="_blank" style="color: #789174">Georgia Public Library Service</a>, <a href="https://www.usg.edu/" target="_blank" style="color: #789174">University System of Georgia</a>, and the <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/investigate/cyber" target="_blank" style="color: #789174">Federal Bureau of Investigation</a>. Each of them pointed out that there has been a dramatic increase in cyber attack cases this year and gave advice on how to protect and/or conduct penetration testing on our own networks by using tools like <a href="https://georgialibraries.org/" target="_blank" style="color: #789174">pfSense</a> and <a href="https://otx.alienvault.com/" target="_blank" style="color: #789174">AlienVault OTX</a>. On the less technical side of things, we learned about good security policy practices &#40;e.g., the NIST Cybersecurity Framework & CIA Triad&#58; <b>C</b>onfidentiality, <b>I</b>ntegrity, and <b>A</b>vailability&#41; to control the flow of information, how to properly inform our staff on threats such as phishing and ransomware, and how to create an incident response plan.<br><br>All of the presentations in this category were of interest to me because they provided important insights &#40;based on real data&#41; for cyber atttack trends that I must continue to educate myself on, and how to mitigate those attacks as an I.T. professional.

                                            <p>Almost all libraries in Georgia have adopted Chrome OS devices in one way or another. These Chrome Devices such as Chomebooks and Chromeboxes and incredibly easy to manage, monitor, and safeguard. They are near-perfect solutions for kiosks and simple web browsing environments, so naturally, libraries are increasingly gravitating toward Chrome and their ease of use.<br><br>A couple of the presentations I attended offered advanced tutorials for Google device management and configuration. These were of great relevance to me because I currently manage a handful of public chrome devices, and it's important to stay on top of the trainings because Google interfaces tend to change frequently. I learned about managing user accounts, closing out user accounts, group management, and upcoming changes to the platform, which will help me in my future installations.

                                            <p>An introductory presentation I found interesting was about the role that artificial intelligence & machine learning &#91;will&#93; play in government. There were no live demonstrations or trainings per se, mainly because this topic can be so specific to execute and requires a lot of prerequisite knowledge to understand &#40;trust me, I took a machine learning class in college and it can <i>not</i> be covered in an hour&#41;, but what the presentation did teach me is that there are a lot of great innovations on the horizon for libraries once artificial intelligence becomes more mainstream. AI will be used to collect valuable insights from patron data and protect networks from intrusion, among other use cases that have not yet been discovered. Still, it is an important topic worth educating myself on for the future.</p>

Without it, essential services and access to critical information is very often unattainable. For public libraries, it is of utmost importance to know how to make information accessible for all people with disabilities. In a presentation hosted by the <a href="https://cidi.gatech.edu/" target="_blank" style="color: #789174">Georgia Tech Center for Inclusive Design and Innovation</a> I learned about various solutions that offer utility and usability for patrons that are challenged by disabilities, such as braille services, e&#45;text services, digital UX services, and audio description services. With this presentation, I now have the knowledge to accommodate any requests for assistive technology.</p>
