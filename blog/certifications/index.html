Certifications have their place in other fields too, but it is safe to say that their pursuit is almost expected in I.T. culture. Many of the rules &amp; best practices of I.T. are contantly changing, so certifications provide assurance to employers that the person they are interviewing really does have a grasp on the subject matter and they are not simply fabricating their resum&eacute;.
                                                <br><br>
                                                There are hundreds of certifications ranging from broad to specific technologies provided by the likes of <span style="color: #00a1d9">Cisco</span>, <span style="color: #00a1d9">Microsoft</span>, <span style="color:#00a1d9">Apple</span>, and <span style="color: #00a1d9">Google</span>, just to name a few. Some may be obtainable right out of college, and some may take years of dedication to climb toward. They may test on conceptual knowledge using a test, they may require concrete experience, or something in between. Regardless, they all provide <span style="color:#df6c32;">credibility</span>,<span style="color:#df6c32;"> marketability</span>, and <span style="color:#df6c32;">professional &amp; personal development</span>. They can make a huge difference when one is applying or negotiating pay for a new position because it confirms that one has a certain level of experience.
